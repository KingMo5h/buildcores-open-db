# Three.js Configurator Sample

This example demonstrates how a simple configurator could load and display 3D component models with [Three.js](https://threejs.org/).

## Running the Example

1. Start a local HTTP server in this directory. You can use Python's built-in server:

```bash
python3 -m http.server 8000
```

2. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8000/index.html`.

The page will load a couple of low-poly models from the public Three.js examples and display them with orbit controls.
